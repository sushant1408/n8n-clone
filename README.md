This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then run the prisma studio:

```bash
npx prisma studio
```

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
